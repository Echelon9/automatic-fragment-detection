*Even though some say that by revealing the result , one 's family will also get depressed and this will affect the whole family .
*Examples lift upgrading , slopes for wheel chairs and old folk corner .
*Facilities such as , having lifts on every floor , installing features like support handbars in the toilets and along common corridors to assist in the mobility of the elderly and installing an alert alarm system in the house when the elderly residents need to seek for any emergency help HDB .
*Factors That Hamper the Innovation of Engineering Design China has been developing very fast these years .
*Firstly , by making sure that the house has single level living , no steps in main entries , no obstruction in the hall way and bedrooms open to the sitting room can reduce the accidents at home for the elderly .
*Firstly , the increased of longevity as the elderly are leading longer lives .
*For a fact that such models were not considered during the design process at TMI , instead shows the lack of preparatory work from commitment , one of Bernhard 's major areas of psychological consideration .
*For example , `` Fall Detection System '' which can detect the fall of person especially elder people and can send instant message via sms to relatives so that the person can get immediate help in critical situations .
*For example , `` if a woman discovers she has a disorder and her sister is pregnant '' .

*In the article The Generation of Innovations , Rogers stressed that the engineering design process for innovation including `` problem recognition , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and consequences '' .
*Increasing in the rates due that oldsters are more prone to illnesses .
*Installation of more ramps in residential areas , which are designed to have a gentle gradient so that it is user friendly for people in wheel chair , new lifts replacements with bigger button showing larger text and better lit buttons in lifts so that the old who are visually unsound can see and press for the correct floor .
*It is known that by having a healthy lifestyle , one will have fewer health problems ; and thus , spending less on healthcare .
*It is not wise to allocate large public spending on the aged due to social problems such as ageing population , but instead , set the sights further , tackle the root of the problem , which is to educate the public the way to plan financially for their future .
*It may not seem like a major issue in Singapore from the public 's eyes , but not so in the near future .
*Just one week ago , a case of a daughter cheated on her mother into selling her apartment away and took away the sum of money , leaving her mother homeless on the street .
*Last but not the least ; engineers are trying hard to put their dream in to reality .

*Long term storage of nuclear waste and the amount of time the nuclear waste needs to be fully decomposed .
*Moreover , lead is abundant , and uranium resources can last us for the next 250 years or so ; making However , NGNPs are not only capable of generating electricity like coal and gas power plants ; they can also simultaneously produce hydrogen .
*Not forgetting that through the functions of education , the government can increase or influence the citizens ' thoughts and awareness on being socially and morally responsible to the population , including the aged as well , quoting the threats of the flu epidemics .
*Not try to accommodate the aging issue while limiting public spending on the aged .
*Public spending towards encouraging higher birth rates .
*Sad to say , no impact and people are still sitting at these seats and worst still , even when there was older folks standing around .
*Since SCWR is a combine and expanse of old Light Water reactor and fossil fuel fired boiler , which are commonly deployed and widely used around the world .
*Some common conditions such as rheumatism , failing eyesight and hearing , dementia , Parkinson 's disease , all of which render them unfit for work .
*Some might think is the individual choice that whether to tell the result out .
*Step by step , from design , fabricate to assemble .
*Subsequently , various groups of experts from the nuclear and chemical industry investigated into this case , and some of them came into a conclusion that the most essential way to prevent such catastrophe from happening again lied in the enhancement of psychological education to people ; whereas the others opposed that the main problem was actually the design failures of the plant , and the prevention could hardly be simply regarded as a psychological issue .
*Take the NUS eco-car project for example which was engineered by NUS and still in the research stage .
*Take the NUS FSAE race car project for example .
*Technology applications such as Telemedicine which aids the tracking and handling of medical reports and appointments which in return , encourages elderly to keep track of their personal health through a cost and time effective system .
*Thanks to the many inventors , researchers , developers and governmental agencies that have helped to make these products available to the general public .
*The government has to reserve more budgets for taking care of the aged because they are more likely to suffer from ailments that almost occur in the old age while still have a chance to come up with other diseases like adults .
*The reason being that the standard of living is rising and adult children find it difficult to provide for their parents , especially those stricken with illness .
*Therefore , having more time and energy in caring for the emotional needs of the elderly .
*These problems may cause impacts to the market ; like unavailability of new products , poor design outcome and changing mindsets of potential designers .
*Thus , enjoying their golden age .
*Thus , having the elderly to gain greater acceptance in using the wheelchair when they do need one .
*Universal Design for Built Environment .
*When this situation occurs , doctors and professionals who have the knowledge and experiences to make the decision of revealing the results .
*Which is why , better air quality is one of human need that should be given priority .
*While , different countries have different way to perform these stages .
*While , the appearance of laptop was due to the working demands from workers in company .
*While , the workshops who simply copy the design just do the procedure directly with low prime cost .
*While , things does not get on as it seems to be .
According to a definition on the Wikipedia website , aging population , of which three causes are usually migration , longer life expectancy , and decreased birth rate , is the increase in the number and proportion of the older people in the society .
According to a report , the rate of survival in every fifty patients of mean age 68 years old undergoing Robotic Radical Cystectomy is 98 % .
According to the book by Ullman , David G. , there are ten building stages in the engineering design processes .
According to these , there is no way to sacrifice people 's health to conduct tracking for any purpose .
Additional , for a long time , Chinese main population-controlling has been `` one child '' policy .
After the discovery of penicillin , people realize that there is a new species of medicine , antibiotic , which can kill bacteria and research are conducted to develop more antibiotics .
Aging population is the result of the increase in the expectancy rate over several centuries and continues to increase because of advancements in medication .
Also , a vicious cycle will be created by the criminals using RFID to attack their targets and followed by the police using RFID to detect those criminals .
Also benefits such as national medical subsidy scheme are introduced to subsidies the medical cost for the elderly .
Alternatively , they can stay at home and choose among tens of local and international channels to watch or can surf internet to visit millions of websites .
Although it is true that ageing population is less severe in developing countries at present , it may not stay true for the future .
Although Singapore literacy rate is relatively high as compared to the rest of the world , I still believe that can be done .
Another example is Netherlands , whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level , have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable .
Another great benefit under the extremely high temperature reactors can be used to split hydrogen from water thermochemically .
Another scheme that Singapore government adopt is the Central Provident Fund , people have to save a part of their salary every month , upon retirement , they are able to withdraw and use it for their old age .
Another strategy that he stated would be to emphasize filial obligation and encourage the willingness of tomorrow 's grown children , so as to lower the government spending on elder dependency .
As a result , better healthcare services and facilities are created and have effectively reduced healthcare cost and elderly dependency .
As aging population in some aspect has been linked with the negative social impact , thus a social policy plays an important part to reduce the effect which will otherwise cause social disintegration of a country .
As Declan Butler said that nuclear energy is not a source of carbon dioxide , and with the emissions of the green-house gas now soaring , and the energy demands predicted to double by 2050 , the nuclear option is a finding its way back onto the table .
As for 3M 's Post-its , it comes in very handy when people want to remind themselves of events or when commenting on essays without having the need to write in the essay itself .
As implemented in Singapore , filial obligation is drafted in law , which means that children are compulsory to take care of their parents ' elder life , agreeing to the quote `` It would be agreed that children owe to their parents respect and kindness generally and assistance in case of infirmity or any special need ' .
As such , the couple suffers in silence , having to face social stigma and having their dreams of building their family shattered .
Because of such influence , it affects the commercial , diffusion and adoption stages of the engineering design process .
Because of the fertility decline , together with the expected shrinking population , subsequently , the dependency ratio will sharply increase .
Both technologies are globally adopted by public , and bring benefit to the whole society .
But since the living cost in Singapore has been so high that it is even called as the 10th most expensive city , government may consider increasing incentives to increase the population of new generation therefore , increasing the total number of work force and reducing the percentage of total aging population .
By 2030 , this percentage is predicted to reach 18.4 % for those aged 65 and above .
By exchanging expertise , multiple solutions may be generated .
Comparing the two solutions , alternate sources of energy like wind energy , hydroelectric energy or nuclear energy significantly reduces the amount of greenhouse gas produced .
Critics argue that such surveillance technology is able to track an individual 24\/7 , thus there is a compromise of one 's privacy .
Critics of nuclear energy claim that nuclear energy generation produces a large amount of radioactive waste products ; and eventually , storage spaces will run out , making nuclear energy unsustainable .
Despite the fact of the low production cost , people are claiming that the construction cost of nuclear power plant is too expensive .
Equally important , lighting is another concern about the elder 's health , especially the eyes .
Exercise can help them to improve blood circulation , bone strength and immune systems functions .
Firstly , most of them have higher pest and disease resistance .
For Bionic eyes , it was done via research after seeing it in a movie called ` Terminator ' , where a woman is able to zoom on places that are far away .
For example , a bridge would be built to link Tan Tock Seng General Hospital to Ren Ci Community Hospital that enables the patient from Tan Tock Seng General Hospital who is stabilized to be moved to Ren Ci Community Hospital for recovery and pay lesser for the cost of healthcare .
For example , the United States is considered spending more money on heath care than any other nation in the world , approximately 15.3 % of GDP and expected to reach 19.5 % of GDP by 2017 .
For example , western powers like countries in Europe and the United States is planning to construct large scales solar energy farms in areas in Africa like the Sahara desert to replace generating energy from fossil fuels .
For instance , it is the project work in junior college .
Funds directed to other areas for the country 's development will also benefit the society .
Furthermore , MSR 's fuel doubles up as its coolant due to the good heat transportation properties of molten salts further reduce on the waste produced .
Furthermore , the way of testing is give you a lot of question and solve them quickly but not give you one question and solve it in many ways .
HAZOP is conducted every 3 years and it is used to update the design of the plant or equipment in case of any changes .
However , as technology improves , RFID is more frequently used to track people .
However , because of lacking of financial incentives , there is still no official announcement that allows this .
However , it must be recognized that these polices have its limitations and have left out a significant portion of the aged in the lurch .
However , many engineers educated in universities usually focus more on how to get a solution using formulas and laws .
However , not only facilities but also the treatments of patients should also be improved .
However , there are still numerous factors which hamper the innovation of engineering design in my country .
However , these 2 problems are enough to cause the downfall and failure of the product when placed in the market .
However , with the shift to an aging population , the purpose of possessing a mobile phone changes back to the original functions which are to keep in contact and for emergency .
However it would be too extreme to impose such a ban .
If a person did not disclose the result , a child with genetic disabilities may born and then lead to problems in the family .
If RFID chips are inserted into prisoners , we are able to track down the escapees so as to prevent worst-case scenarios from happening , for example like the case of Singapore 's Mas Selamat case where , Mas Selamat , an important player in terrorism managed to escape from the prison .
If there are no limits implemented , the normal citizens could abuse the system by using it indiscriminately and denying the rights of healthcare to truly needy patients .
If there is no one wants to accept a new creative product , it will be hard for it to exist in the market and will also deter people to participate in the engineering design process for innovations .
In a nutshell , current development on policy reforms and researches has been carried out simultaneously over the past decades to help cope with both societal and physical impact .
In addition , RFID tagged offenders that are serving their term in the community ; this can help to enforce their home curfews .
In addition to all these policies , filial piety and greater familial support is also emphasised as the government encouraged the children to take care of their parents when they are older as this will ease the funding of the government for each and every of the elderly , but instead only focused on the needy elderly who has no children to look after them .
In conclusion , for a country to be successful , it not only has to look after the well-beings , in this case , the elderly , but also to ensure the continuous development of the country in the economy , education and technology sectors .
In conclusion , nuclear energy may have some seemingly advantages , however , the problems associated with it is not negligible .
In conclusion , public spending on the elderly is necessary , however to a certain extent .
In conclusion , the decision of whether to reveal the results of genetic testing should lie only on the individual and not other third parties involved .
In conclusion , tracking devices should be allowed in tracking people , as it is able to change human lives for the better , and even prevent or reduce crime rates .
In each areas , inventions are solving practical problems that may happen on aged people .
In fact , it might bring additional work to the security force as they now have to take care of minor issue capture by the surveillance technology and cause them to overlook the real threat to our security .
In fact , robotic surgery has a history of about 75 years , however ; it is only during the last 5 years that it was gradually recognized by the medical community .
In my essay , I shall discuss about the key features of nuclear reactor and its comparison with other alternative energy sources .
In my opinions , the government should use much more money on taking care of elder people because the following reason : Firstly , the aged are citizens who contributed a lot of money to National Treasury through compulsory taxes like land-tax , income tax ... Because in this way or another , that was their money , they are deserved to receive more care from the authority .
In Singapore , there are problems that hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
In Singapore , we can see that this problem is occurring .
In Singapore case , where we heavily depend on the ever advancing technology to create new industries and job opportunities , Research and Development spending must be guaranteed so as to ensure the country 's economic growth in the future .
In the past , around 1930 , there were two prototype refrigerators .
In this way , these benefiters can fulfill their basic responsibilities better , in taking care of their own families with the higher purchasing power they have .
Issues being discussed were safety of operating the nuclear reactor as there have been catastrophic events in the past like the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl disaster .
It is also against human rights to leave a helpless person to be tortured by illnesses and die .
It is because of the elderly who had once before participle in many aspects of national building such as education .
It is likely that this genetically modified plant was give three hundred percent yield is actually not surviving until harvest .
It is only accepted and marketed by the company after sending samples out to each Fortune 500 companies for them to test the product and received good feedbacks on the product .
It may be objected that if an elderly took too much time crossing the road , it may cause traffic congestion at the road conjunctions .
It was observed that the main contractors wanted to avoid troubles and further expenses for rectifications of minor faults , and hence resulted in the negligence .
Lastly , Residual Model policies are in placed to ease the aging process as they act as the last straw of the social safety net when the elderly have inability of self-reliance or no familial support .
Lastly , the benefits that the researchers had predicted are not totally beneficial to human .
Limiting public spending on the aged should not be implemented in view of the small fraction spent on welfare .
Mac , on the opposite , was designed for an entertainment and easy-to-use purpose .
Meanwhile , surveillance on lax supervisors may evidently verify their incompetence .
Moreover , conventionally generated technology and innovation receive different attitudes from other people .
Moreover , the customers may take both product as the same and the `` fake '' ones are more attractive with incredible price .
Moreover , the minorities who do not have proper job or income do not have a medical care account will not be taken care by the health service .
Moreover , the policy on science and engineering also affects process of engineering application due to insufficient investment in research and engineering practice .
Moreover , when there are no new products , these potential customers are lost .
Namely , mutual surveillance guarantees active working environments , as well as bringing high productivity and huge profits to the employers .
Next , a substantial amount of the annual budget should also be set aside for urban development and education .
Normally the lawsuits of patent infringement can be settled out of court due to the high cost and complicated procedures .
Not only helping the oldsters , it also encourages youngsters to plan financially for their old age which eases the aging process very effectively .
Nowadays , in the Singapore context , we have special entrance and places for the disabled older generations in MRT .
People will learn to be self-reliance when their support is being limited , in this case , the funding for usage of healthcare and public facilities ; they will have to plan their future needs .
Plagiarism significantly hinders the process of steps after gathering pertinent information in the engineering design process , which is about generating , analyzing , selecting , testing and implementing solutions .
Products generated by each environment may appear similar but actually differ in many ways and the environment plays an important part in shaping its distinctive features .
Program such as The Befriender Service , provided by Lions Befrienders is working closely with Central Singapore ComCare Local Networks in the aim of easing the loneliness , isolation and boredom of the single elderly and the homebound and also providing services such as advisory and assistance to the elderly .
Public spending for the health care sector would benefit everyone and could prove to be very effective .
RFID can be used to track people movement and location , using the Location-based Tracking System or Global Positioning Satellite System .
Secondly , in the present , mobile phones are used commonly and most of the people around the world have at least one mobile phone .
Since , the advantages of revealing the results of genetic tests outweigh in most situations , therefore , an individual should not have the absolute authority to reveal their test results .
Since this problem is so widespread , it is essential it be given priority over others .
Singapore government made contribution of salary to the Central Provident Fund as a regulation or compelled by law , helped in easing the aging process .
So we do not need to worry big catastrophes like Chernobyl accident will repeat again .
Some people would disagree with the use of surveillance technology as it is an intrusion to their privacy and for fear that personal information could be stolen and used against their interests .
Taking it from the parents ' perspective , some of them may not even consider the Act as being abandoned by their children is regarded as a shameful matter .
The ageing population is often associated with poor health thus exerts low productivity .
The amount of money that is required to build these is usually an astrological amount .
The benefits having our products tagged with RFID is overwhelming from commercial to healthcare .
The Central Provident Fund in Singapore is inclusive social saving plan that require savings from the labor force in order to prepare better for aging population in retirement , health care , home ownership and family protection in the future .
The consumers had many ambivalence and unwillingness at that time .
The contribution they once made , be it little or a lot , helped to build up the country .
The cost of building a more suitable healthcare , infrastructure , transportation , housing , pension and financial aid for the elderly is necessary to help ease the aging process as the elderly health and economic value decline , and emotional and social problems rose , but these spending should be limited .
The current architecture improvement and research and development on technological products for the elderly have helped them to overcome the difficulty they faced when their physical health deteriorates .
The first step of defining the problem is very important so that an engineer would not lost on the way finding the solution .
The great knowledge of many talented engineers has fulfilled many human requirements , which results directly to an ordinary life .
The most serious problem which hampers the innovation process is that the technological base is relatively lower than the developed world .
The new generation 4 nuclear reactor promises excellent solution with its byproduct will decay in just decades .
The problem has significant impacts on the step of testing and implementing solutions in the design process , during which an engineer may encounter different problems and choices .
The public are afraid that the high temperatures in the nuclear reactors will be a major hazard for the people working in and those living near the reactors .
The statement highlights that the architecture development in Singapore was not to a large extend .
Then , to invest nuclear energy becomes quite important and emergency .
Then let the bath water flows through the tubes and absorbs the heat collected by the tubes .
Then US treated this new technology as their most precious weapon , of course it was deserved .
There are many aspects in our society that require us to devote our resources on them .
There are several ways to reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency .
There is a need to understand that the amount of reliance the aged have on the public is quite significant , also to take into account of the contributions the aged have made and as well as to recognize the more substantial advancement in other main areas of development over the aged .
There should be a limit on public spending on the aged so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country 's development is a suggestion that should be implemented in order to combat the rising cost of healthcare for the elderly .
Therefore , in most cases , the technology that is selected is usually not the technology with the most advantages to the consumers .
Therefore , their balance can be improved and lead a better life .
Therefore there is still a part to play for the public owner .
Thereinto , Burj Al-Arab hotel , the most grand and luxury hotel worldwide once accomplished in Dec 1999 , was certainly becoming one of the most dazzling architecture at that time .
These funds are then used to either solve a current problem in a country , for example , an ageing population where help is needed to ensure livelihood of the older generation , easing the burden the current generation have on taking care of the old .
They tend to have a psychological effects of letting down their guards in the designs where the standards are not as strict and often lead to carelessness , negligence and eventually accident .
Thirdly , the aging people are very important to the society and country .
This can help doctors monitor patients from their home or workplace , in the comfort of the hospital , and react promptly in a medical situation .
This compromises the opportunity cost that this amount can be used on , namely on education , health care and creating economic growth .
This imbalance ultimately affects the healthcare industry .
This is because as people aged , their health will deteriorate and results in the increase of healthcare and social cost .
This is due to countries becoming more affluent and thus have better living environment and are also more educated to be conscious of their health .
This is very useful towards families with young juveniles and aging parents because their location could be tracked easily if they are lost in the crowd and thus preventing them from any possible harm they may encounter .
This lack of government support means , engineers will not able to get resources , raw materials , precise equipment for research during engineering design process .
This misunderstanding not only creates unnecessary psychological , economic as well as social burdens on the carrier of a known genetic risk , family ties will also be affected .
This prediction is further supported by a survey conducted by the World Bank , which claims the continuously increasing expected lifespan since 1960 .
This shows that the current research and development has helped to overcome some of the problems the againg population may face in the aging process like fallen eyesight and lack of technological knowledge .
This will result in dire consequences for example ; there will not be proper family planning since genetic disorder is not taken into consideration , which might results in continued breeding of undesirable genetic traits off-springs .
Through the use of these specific reasons and examples , I will demonstrate why especially in the field of medicine .
Thus , even the cost of robotic surgery is relatively higher than conventional surgery ; most people believe that the money is worthy spent .
To activate it , simply give it a voice command .
To reduce this over - reliance , Singapore has been taking careful measures in her education system , for instance her first IT Masterplan for education in 1997 , ensuring that Singaporeans have sufficient IT skills for future endeavors .
Today , modern medicine can even prolong the lives of people who have diseases for which we do not yet have a cure .
Towards its development to today 's technology , the policy maker played an important part in it .
Until 1940s , more than ten years after Fleming 's discovery , penicillin went into mass production .
When there is more expenditure on social services and benefits , education , infrastructure and development projects , the country is capable of build a better economy for its people .
With a better economy , more energy could be invested into the research sector to discover more inventions to improve our lives .
With higher education , people will be able to earn more income and thus save more for the future .
With that value in placed , responsibility in taking care of the elderly should not be pushed to the government but the people themselves .
With the coming of economic crisis , government should be much more concerned about the developments of the country .
Without being able to hear clearly , the elderly can not hear emergency horns when they are crossing the road or can not enjoy simple pleasures like watching the television .
